### How to PULL into the main project

For very first start any update are welcome.
Think about project as your own future project or Ecosystem
Any site require a huge amount of components: Shopping charts, info lists, scrool automation, effects.
So for firts few weeks (till center-end of november) we require a lot of small components: text areas, buttons etc.
For now as default you can choose PIZZA colortheme (red, yellow, dark-red, green, white)

Also you can improove any instructions especially if they are is unclear.
